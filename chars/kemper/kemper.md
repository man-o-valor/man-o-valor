## Kemper "Khan" Cleft
- Topaz dragon, so he's orange-yellow colored and shiny
- Has 4 horns, and the front ones have cut off hovering tips that stay perfectly aligned as if they were connected
- Shoulders and elbows have pairs of spikes on them, visible under clothing as well
- Typically wears purple, which also complements his eye, inner ear, and tongue color
- Canonically quite strong but don't feel pressured to draw something if you can't ofc
- Not technically a furry, but drawing him is similar enough

**More personality things:**
- Super friendly guy
- He's a little aggressive and might make more introverted people slightly uncomfortable on purpose
- About 23 years old
- He's that one guy who likes hot sauce in his beer lol
- He won't stay mad at anyone or at least will never stop joking with them
- basically is always smirking
- literally embodies the concept of confidence
